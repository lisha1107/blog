Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.

1. Converting too many notebooks at the same (multiprocessing) causes `zmq.error.ZMQError: Address already in use`.
    The simple way to fix this issue is to limit the number of processes converting notebooks.
    It is suggested that you keep in within 3.

2. You can execute a notebook without converting it to a different format using the following command.

        :::bash
        jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute mynotebook.ipynb

    This will generate another notebook with the output inlined.
    You can use the option `--inplace` to overwrite the file inplace.

        :::bash
        jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --inplace --execute mynotebook.ipynb
